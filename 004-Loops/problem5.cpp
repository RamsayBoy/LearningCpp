/*
    Write a program that provides the option of tallying up the results of a poll with 3 possible values
    The first input to the program is the poll question; the next three inputs are the possible answers
    The first answer is indicated by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3
    The answers are tallied until a 0 is entered

    The program should then show the results of the pollâ€”try making a bar graph that shows the results
    properly scaled to fit on your screen no matter how many results were entered
