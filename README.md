## ATTENTION
If you know how to improve some of the codes (or .md files) or you see some error feel free to contribute.

If you see, for example, that in the "003-If Statements" folder there are codes that do not use the switch statement instead of a lot of if ones, it is because codes were made by following a book. If I use instructions "I have not learnt yet" it would not make sense or it would be like cheating.

Some of the problems consist of doing problems I did before but with the new knoledge I go learning, like changing the if statements with a switch one, adding functions, etc.

Also, the author makes you realize that you cannot do things like, for example, go back to a certain line of your code, with the knowledge you currently have, but he teaches you later how loops works. That is what happens in 003-IfStatements/problem4.cpp, for example. He makes you think about what things, that you do not know yet, could help you to do something and then he teaches you ways for doing that.
